/*
Given three integers 
A
A, 
B
B, and 
C
C, determine their sum.
Your task is to implement the function getSum(A, B, C) which returns the sum 
A
+
B
+
C
A+B+C.
Constraints
1
≤
A
,
B
,
C
≤
1
0
0
1≤A,B,C≤100
Sample test case #1
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
Expected Return Value = 6
Sample test case #2
A = 100
B = 100
C = 100
Expected Return Value = 300
Sample test case #3
A = 85
B = 16
C = 93
Expected Return Value = 194
Sample Explanation
In the first case, 
A

B
+
C
=
1

2
+
3
=
6
A+B+C=1+2+3=6.
